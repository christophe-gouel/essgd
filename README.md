# essgd

## Installation


If you use the straight package:
```
(use-package essgd
  :straight (:type git :host github :repo "sje30/essgd"))
```

Otherwise download the lisp file, open in Emacs, and do M-x
eval-buffer to get started.

Laurent Gatto has written a nice R package called 
[plothistory](https://github.com/lgatto/plothistory).  This is not
Emacs-specific, and in my testing, works well remotely via TRAMP.
